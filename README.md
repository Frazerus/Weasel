### What is the difference between git and github?
Github is a website where git repositories are hosted, git is the actual version control system which handles how files are saved, committed, pushed, pulled and so on.
### Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- Easy experimentation with branches, merging and resetting
- History of everything that happened
- concurrent working on different branches & with local changes
### Name 3 alternatives to git:
- Mercurial
- Subversion
- Perforce
### Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
Git vs SVN (Subversion)
- branches only refer to specific commit vs branches created as directories inside repository
- each installation can be server and client vs separate client and server where files are stored, files only locally as copy -> constant communication with server
### Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
- git handles binary files terribly -> evey binary file is kept at any time on every development machine -> giant repositories
